Threaded discussions can be described by two different methods in SIOC. In the first and most-used method, a Forum is the container_of a Post, which then has a number of reply posts as shown by the has_reply links in Figure 11.4. Alternately, one may wish to use an intermediary Thread container to contain various Posts as shown by the container_of links, and either deduce the threaded structure from the dates of the Posts or also include information about the reply structure. In the sec- ond case, these Threads would be contained within parent Forums.
