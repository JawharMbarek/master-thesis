@article{Ankolekar2007,
abstract = {A common perception is that there are two competing vi- sions for the future evolution of the Web: the Semantic Web and Web 2.0. A closer look, though, reveals that the core technologies and concerns of these two approaches are com- plementary and that each field can and must draw from the others strengths. We believe that future web applications will retain the Web 2.0 focus on community and usability, while drawing on Semantic Web infrastructure to facilitate mashup-like information sharing. However, there are sev- eral open issues that must be addressed before such applica- tions can become commonplace. In this paper, we outline a semantic weblogs scenario that illustrates the potential for combining Web 2.0 and Semantic Web technologies, while highlighting the unresolved issues that impede its realiza- tion. Nevertheless, we believe that the scenario can be real- ized in the short-term. We point to recent progress made in resolving each of the issues as well as future research direc- tions for each of the communities.},

abstract = {In this paper we argue that the effort within the context of Semantic Web research, such as RDF and DAML-S. will allow for better knowledge representation and engineering of educational systems and easier integration of e-learning with other business processes. We also argue that existing educational standards, such as SCORM and LOM could be mapped to those technologies, providing for more efficient automation of processes like educational resource annotation, and intelligent accessibility management. In this way we can use a successful combination of the technical advances outside of educational context and the existing educational standards, and allow for easier interoperability. To illustrate these issues and a solution approach we present the OntoAIMS educational environment.},

abstract = {Dublin Core is often presented as a modern form of catalog card -- a set of elements (and now qualifiers) that describe resources in a complete package. Sometimes it is proposed as an exchange format for sharing records among multiple collections. The founding principle that "every element is optional and repeatable" reinforces the notion that a Dublin Core description is to be taken as a whole. This paper, in contrast, is based on a much different premise: Dublin Core is a language. More precisely, it is a small language for making a particular class of statements about resources. Like natural languages, it has a vocabulary of word-like terms, the two classes of which -- elements and qualifiers -- function within statements like nouns and adjectives; and it has a syntax for arranging elements and qualifiers into statements according to a simple pattern.},

@article{Burt2003,
abstract = {This paper is about social structure defining an advantage in creating good ideas, and people reproducing the social structure as they discuss their ideas. The hypothesis is that people who live in the intersection of social worlds are at higher risk of having good ideas. Qualifications come immediately to mind, but the gist of the hypothesis is familiar in sociology and makes intuitive sense: ways of thinking and behaving are more homogenous within than between groups, so people connected to otherwise segregated groups are more likely to be familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving, which gives them the option of selecting and synthesizing alternatives. I describe anecdotal and aggregate evidence consistent with the hypothesis, but my goal in this paper is to study the hypothesis in finer detail, at the level of individuals, to talk about ideas as a catalyst for the performance effects of social capital. I use archival and survey data on people managing the supply chain in a large American electronics company to show how compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas were disproportionately in the hands of managers rich in the social capital of bridging structural holes. Managers whose discussion networks more often spanned structural holes were more likely to express their ideas, less likely to have their ideas dismissed by senior management, and more likely to have their ideas evaluated as valuable. I infer that social capital created a vision advantage in which people who spanned structural holes were more likely to have good ideas. Value remains a step removed, however, because having a good idea is distinct from doing something with it. The good ideas were discussed with colleagues in a way that reproduced the existing social structure. Good ideas emerged from the intersection of social worlds, but spread in a way that continued segregation between the worlds.},

abstract = {Purpose – Aims to investigate the way that the semantic web is being used to represent and process social network information. Design/methodology/approach – The Swoogle semantic web search engine was used to construct several large data sets of Resource Description Framework (RDF) documents with social network information that were encoded using the “Friend of a Friend” (FOAF) ontology. The datasets were analyzed to discover how FOAF is being used and investigate the kinds of social networks found on the web. Findings – TheFOAFontology is the most widely used domain ontology on the semantic web. People are using it in an open and extensible manner by defining new classes and properties to use with FOAF. Research limitations/implications – RDF data was only obtained from public RDF documents published on the web. Some RDF FOAF data may be unavailable because it is behind firewalls, on intranets or stored in private databases. The ways in which the semantic web languages RDF and OWLare being used (and abused) are dynamic and still evolving.Asimilar study done two years from now may show very different results. Originality/value – This paper describes how social networks are being encoded and used on the world wide web in the form of RDF documents and the FOAF ontology. It provides data on large social networks as well as insights on how the semantic web is being used in 2005.},

So far, the large amount of RDF data available online has not been utilized to the extent possible. SECO, the application presented in this paper, aggregates, integrates, and displays RDF data obtained from the Semantic Web. SECO collects the RDF data available in files using a crawler, and also utilizes RDF repositories as sources for data. Integration tasks over the various data sources, such as object consolidation and schema mapping, are carried out using a reasoning engine and are encapsulated in mediators to which software agents can pose queries using a remote query interface. SECO includes a user interface component that emits HTML, which allows for human users to browse the integrated data set.},

Complementary discussions exist on disparate systems but it is currently difficult to exploit the available distributed information. A Semantically Interlinked Online Community (SIOC) can enable efficient information dissemination across communities by creating an ontology that will model concepts identified in discussion methods. Data instances can be accessed from community sites using this ontology, enabling connections between local and remote concept instances, and allowing queries on, or transfer of, the data. By searching on one forum, the ontology and interface will allow users to find information on other forums that use a SIOC-based system architecture. Other uses include cross-site querying, topic-related searches, and the importing of SIOC data into other systems. Fusing information and inferring links among various applications and types of information with SIOC provide relevant insights that make the community information available on the internet more valuable.},

abstract = {Todays students, being used to constant activity and multitasking in their everyday life, need a high level of social and creative engagement in order to learn; for them, highly interactive learning environments which allow for communication, collaboration, and authoring, are a must. In addition, modern learning theories stress the importance of interactivity and engagement of students for successful learning processes, whereas recent empirical studies provide evidence and confirm this. In this paper, we present how the integration of Social and Semantic Web technologies, often referred to as the Social Semantic Web (SSW), along with the Linked Data paradigm can improve the interactivity of todays learning environments, while putting students in control of their learning process spanning across different tools and services. We identify the main principles on which such SSW-supported personal learning environments are based, and illustrate them thorough the design, implementation, analysis, and evaluation of DEPTHS (DEsign Patterns Teaching Help System) a SSW-based interactive personal learning environment we have developed for the domain of software design patterns.},

Formalising structural aspects of LOs, the ontology facilitates re-purposing of LOs at different levels of content granularity, i.e. LOs in their entirety and their components. Furthermore, being a generic LO content model, the ontology serves as an integration point of heterogeneous LO content models.},

The basic idea is to create a set of Java interfaces and classes from an OWL ontology such that an instance of a Java class represents an instance of a single class of the ontology with most of its properties, class- relationships and restriction-definitions maintained. We note that there exist some fundamental semantic differences between Description Logic (DL) and Object Oriented (OO) systems, primarily related to completeness and satisfiability. We present various ways in which we aim to minimize the impact of such differences, and show how to map a large part of the much richer OWL semantics into Java. Finally, we sketch the HarmonIA framework, which is used for the automatic generation of agent systems from institution specifications, and whose OWL Ontology Creation module was the basis for the tool presented in this paper.},

@article{Tosh2004,
abstract = {The e-portfolio is for many a recognised tool employed for a multitude of purposes: employment; assessment; life-long learning; professional development; accreditation of prior learning. The number of institutions adopting some type of e-portfolio system has risen dramatically over the past two years. The e-portfolio is altering learning pedagogy and for some creating a truly learner-centric knowledge environment. Countless institutions are pushing ahead setting up systems to act as e-portfolios, others have grand visions; every citizen in the EU will have an e-portfolio by 2010. Still questions remain: how can we promote student engagement in the process? In the pursuit of assessment data adopted by a positivist model are we missing an opportunity to support deep learning? This short report will explore one idea which could help address the problem of learner engagement creating a scenario where students want to use the system therefore be at the centre of the whole e-portfolio process and in turn, through engagement, benefit from the deep learning potential.},

@article{Wang2012,
abstract = {Facebook is a popular social networking site. It, like many other new technologies, has potential for teaching and learning because of its unique built-in functions that offer pedagogical, social and technological affordances. In this study, the Facebook group was used as a learning management system (LMS) in two courses for putting up announcements, sharing resources, organizing weekly tutorials and conducting online discussions at a teacher education institute in Singapore. This study explores using the Facebook group as an LMS and the students’ perceptions of using it in their courses. Results showed that students were basically satisfied with the affor- dances of Facebook as the fundamental functions of an LMS could be easily imple- mented in the Facebook group. However, using the Facebook group as an LMS has certain limitations. It did not support other format files to be uploaded directly, and the discussion was not organized in a threaded structure. Also, the students did not feel safe and comfortable as their privacy might be revealed. Constraints of using the Facebook group as an LMS, implications for practice and limitations of this study are discussed.},

F\"{u}r nahezu alle Studienrichtungen existieren somit Ans\"{a}tze f\"{u}r den Einsatz der Neuen Medien in der Aus- und Weiterbildung. Die digitalisierten Lehrinhalte sind jedoch je nach F\"{o}rderquelle und Verbundstruktur im jeweiligen Projekt verankert und damit schwer in einem anderen Kontext nutzbar.
